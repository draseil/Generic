I descended a dusty gravel ridge
Beneath the Bixby Canyon Bridge
Until I eventually arrived
At the place where your soul had died
And barefoot in the shallow creek
I grabbed some stones from underneath
And waited for you to speak to me

In the silence, it became so very clear 
That you had long ago disappeared
I cursed myself for being surprised 
That this didn't play like it did in my mind
All the way from San Francisco
As I chased the end of your road
'Cause I've still got miles to go

And I want to know my fate
If I keep up this way
It's hard to want to stay awake
When everyone you meet
They all seem to be asleep
And you wonder if you're missing your dream

You can't see in a dream
You can't see in a dream
You just can't see in a dream
A dream, a dream, a dream, a dream
A dream, a dream, a dream, a dream
A dream, a dream, a dream, a dream

And then it started getting dark
I trudged back to where the car was parked
No closer to any kind of truth
As I must assume was the case with you
