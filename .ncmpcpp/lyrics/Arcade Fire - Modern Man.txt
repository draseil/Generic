So I wait my turn, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like, makes me feel like
So I wait in line, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like, something don't feel right
Like a record that's skipping, I'm a modern man
And the clock keeps ticking, I'm a modern man
Makes me feel like, makes me feel like

In my dream I was almost there
Then you pulled me aside and said, "You're going nowhere"
They say we are the chosen few but we're wasted
And that's why we're still waiting

On a number from the modern man
Maybe when you're older you will understand
Why you don't feel right, why you can't sleep at night now?
In line for a number but you don't understand like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand like a modern man
Oh, I had a dream I was dreaming
And I feel I'm losing the feeling
Makes me feel like like something don't feel right
I erase the number of the modern man
Want to break the mirror of the modern man
Makes me feel like, makes me feel like

In my dream I was almost there
Then you pulled me aside and said, "You're going nowhere"
I know we are the chosen few but we're wasted
And that's why we're still waiting

In line for a number but you don't understand like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand like a modern man
And you feel so right but how come you can't sleep at night?
In line for a number but you don't understand like a modern man
I'm a modern man, I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man, I'm a modern man
