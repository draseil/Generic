In my left hand, there is the familiar
In my right hand, there's the great unknown
I can see the madly different grass there
But I'm drawn to wilder nights at home

Don't listen to your friends
See the despair behind their eyes
Don't listen to your friends
They only care and want to know why

I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

Are you drifting way beyond what's normal
'Cause 'round your mind rings the words that they would say?
When you go home, everything looks different
And you're scared of being left behind

Just listen to your friends
Trust that they're fair, look in their eyes
Just listen to your friends
They only care and hope you're alright

I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

Whoa oh oh oh…
Whoa oh oh oh, ooh… ooh…
Whoa oh oh oh…
Whoa oh oh oh, ooh… ooh…

I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me

I can feel the draw, I can feel it pulling me back
It's pulling me back, it's pulling me
I can feel the draw, the draw, the draw, the draw
